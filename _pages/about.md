Hello!! My name is Megha Mehta.

- - -

Where do I start?

Umm, I think a lot (but I'm trying to think less and do more), I love poems and expressing myself through them (I plan to share a lot of them on here). I have a journal where I write down how I'm feeling or about events/people that changed my life. Looking back at my journal and reflecting on what I wrote about really helps me process my thoughts and learn about what I could have done better or what situations/events I could have avoided or changed. 

For many years, starting a blog was always something I wanted to do but never committed enough to actually execute. That all changed after last year; 2019 was possibly the worst year of my life haha! Saying that it did teach me a lot and I guess I felt that I wanted to share a lot of what I learnt with others.

 I aspire for this blog to be created in a platform of unconditional positive regard (I'll talk more about what this means in one of my next posts). I'm using lessons and knowledge from my life's experiences to share with all of you, in an attempt that you can potentially make better decisions, have better attitudes and continue to live a loose, euphoric and positive life.

If you ever want a friend, someone to talk to or make you smile please message me on any of my socials! Also, let me know if you want me to write about anything that interests you or if you want me to share any of your stories and experiences.

Lots of love,

Megha ‚òÅ
