I wrote this poem styled letter to my grandma when she passed away. She was and always will be a big part of who I am today so I thought it was very appropriate to start my first blog post with something dedicated to her.

Dear grandma,

It's been a week and it still doesn't feel real,

There are times when I am happy and then there are other times when I don't know what to think, I don't know what to feel;

There was so much you wanted to do, go, see and be,

I just wanted you to be happy, you to be free.

But then you were diagnosed and that word sounded so strange,

I knew what it was but didn't expect you to be the one to go through the pain;

There are times like this which makes me realise that life isn't fair,

Because you fought so hard, but life didn't care;

And now you're gone, you're gone too soon,

You didn't get to see my graduation, you didn't get to see me leave school;

I was so excited for this summer to spend all my time with you,

But I remember when I told you, you had said it wouldn't come true. 

It's selfish of me to have wanted you to live for me,

But at the same time I knew you couldn't help it, you were suffering endlessly.

At times like this when I feel so sad,

I feel better knowing that at least you're with your husband, you're with grandad.

You were a beautiful woman who inspired my future and me in so many ways, 

You inspired my art and gave me hope, 

the hope that allowed me to believe that maybe you would still stay;

But now you're gone and I feel fully empty,

I just wish you knew how much more you truly meant to me.

I love you always,

Megha
