Hello beautiful people!!

So sorry for being MIA- I’ve been moving house, however excuses aside, I am going to try and create a regular schedule to upload posts more frequently.

I’ve given it some thought and decided that regardless of my regular posts, I am also going to upload monthly posts where I reflect on the experiences I’ve learnt. Hopefully you guys can relate to some of the things I’ve experienced and learnt or likewise share and/or message me what you’ve learnt. 

So this is for January 2020:

The first month in a new decade,

You came and went so fast,

I barely had time to sort out my life and register all the decisions I had made;

Regardless, this fast paced time taught me so much,

I’ve learned some many important lessons,

About myself and the people I can truly trust;

To the people that have helped me and remained by my side,

Those that made me laugh and

Those that supported me when I cried;

And then there are others, that I miss but are far away,

I see you and I love you,

And I know that despite the distance you’d have helped me in any way;

This decade has just started and the first month has already been so strange,

January 2020 has taught me to expect the unexpected,

And always be ready for change,

Because not everything happens for a reason or as we intend,

which counters how I used to think-

but trust that everything does indeed work out in the end.
