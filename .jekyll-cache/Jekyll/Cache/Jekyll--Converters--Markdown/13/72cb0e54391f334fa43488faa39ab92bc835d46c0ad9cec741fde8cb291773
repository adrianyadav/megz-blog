I"<p>I wrote this poem styled letter to my grandma when she passed away. She was and always will be a big part of who I am today so I thought it was very appropriate to start my first blog post with something dedicated to her.</p>

<p>Dear grandma,</p>

<p>It’s been a week and it still doesn’t feel real,</p>

<p>There are times when I am happy and then there are other times when I don’t know what to think, I don’t know what to feel;</p>

<p>There was so much you wanted to do, go, see and be,</p>

<p>I just wanted you to be happy, you to be free.</p>

<p>But then you were diagnosed and that word sounded so strange,</p>

<p>I knew what it was but didn’t expect you to be the one to go through the pain;</p>

<p>There are times like this which makes me realise that life isn’t fair,</p>

<p>Because you fought so hard, but life didn’t care;</p>

<p>And now you’re gone, you’re gone too soon,</p>

<p>You didn’t get to see my graduation, you didn’t get to see me leave school;</p>

<p>I was so excited for this summer to spend all my time with you,</p>

<p>But I remember when I told you, you had said it wouldn’t come true.</p>

<p>It’s selfish of me to have wanted you to live for me,</p>

<p>But at the same time I knew you couldn’t help it, you were suffering endlessly.</p>

<p>At times like this when I feel so sad,</p>

<p>I feel better knowing that at least you’re with your husband, you’re with grandad.</p>

<p>You were a beautiful woman who inspired my future and me in so many ways,</p>

<p>You inspired my art and gave me hope,</p>

<p>the hope that allowed me to believe that maybe you would still stay;</p>

<p>But now you’re gone and I feel fully empty,</p>

<p>I just wish you knew how much more you truly meant to me.</p>

<p>I love you always,</p>

<p>Megha</p>
